Making an awesome Finch program

The program isn't going to be made randomly. We are following guidelines for a "competition" of sorts. 
Basically, we want the Finch to drive a certain distance (to be decided later) on a track with an obstacle in the middle.
So the Finch will have to: 
1. Move forward a certain distance
2. Be able to look for obstacles and act accordingly
3. Stop once the distance is reached
